Ethical Considerations

It's important to note that while specific laws targeting brute force attacks may not exist in every jurisdiction, such activities typically violate broader statutes related to unauthorized access, data protection, and computer misuse. Engaging in brute force attacks without explicit authorization is illegal and unethical. However, conducting such tests with proper consent for security assessments is generally permissible and can aid in identifying vulnerabilities.
